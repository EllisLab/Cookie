# Cookie

This plugin lets you easily get and set cookies in your ExpressionEngine templates. It automatically respects your ExpressionEngine's cookie preferences so the prefix, domain, and flags are unified with the rest of the application cookies. Since the prefix is handled automatically, just refer to the cookie by its descriptive name, e.g. `example_cookie` instead of `exp_example_cookie`.


## Requirements

- ExpressionEngine 3
- PHP 5.4+

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EllisLab/Cookie/releases/latest).
2. Copy the `cookie` folder to your `system/user/addons` folder (you can ignore the rest of this repository's files).
3. In your ExpressionEngine control panel, visit the Add-On Manager and click Install next to "Cookie".

## Usage

### `{exp:cookie:delete}`

#### Example Usage

This is a single tag that deletes a cookie with the given name.

```
{exp:cookie:delete name='ab_test'}
```

#### Parameters

- `name=` (*required*) - The name of the cookie to delete.

### `{exp:cookie:get}`

#### Example Usage

This is a single tag that retreives and outputs the value of a cookie with the given name.

```
{exp:cookie:get name='ab_test'}
```

#### Parameters

- `name=` (*required*) - The name of the cookie to get.
- `sanitize=` - (`yes`/`no`) Whether or not to perform XSS sanitization on the cookie value, default `yes`.
- `htmlentities=` - (`yes`/`no`) Whether or not to convert all applicable characters to HTML entities, default `yes`. You should always leave this enabled when outputting cookie values to HTML tag attributes or ExpressionEngine tags. Since cookies are user input, it's best to be defensive, and this will also prevent HTML in cookie values from being rendered by the browser.

### `{exp:cookie:set}`

#### Example Usage

This is a single tag that stores a cookie with the given content and name.

```
{exp:cookie:set name="recent_article" value="{entry_id}" expire="1209600"}
```

#### Parameters

- `name=` (*required*) - The name of the cookie to set.
- `value=` (*required*) - The content to store in the cookie.
- `expire=` (*required*) - The time in seconds that the cookie should live.

## Additional Files

You may be wondering what the rest of the files in this package are for. They are solely for development, so if you are forking the GitHub repo, they can be helpful. If you are just using the add-on in your ExpressionEngine installation, you can ignore all of these files.

- **.editorconfig**: [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) helps developers maintain consistent coding styles across files and text editors.
- **.gitignore:** [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) lets you specify files in your working environment that you do not want under source control.
- **.travis.yml:** A [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) configuration file for continuous integration (automated testing, releases, etc.).
- **.composer.json:** A [Composer project setup file](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) that manages development dependencies.
- **.composer.lock:** A [list of dependency versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file) that Composer has locked to this project.
